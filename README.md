### Render the book

- [ ] 1. Install **bookdown** with `install.packages("bookdown")`. If you already have it, update to the [latest version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=bookdown).

- [ ] 2. Render locally with `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")`.  
   # `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book")` to render a bookdown and create a pdf at the same time

- [ ] 3. Use `browseURL("docs/index.html")` to view your book locally (or just open `index.html` in a browser).

- [ ] 4. If it looks good, commit and push all changed files to GitHub. 

(You will need to repeat steps 2 and 4 every time you wish to update the book online.)
