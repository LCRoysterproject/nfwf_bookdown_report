##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from December through April 2022. We have developed a detailed draft analyses of the oyster count data from the winter 2021/2022 sampling events as an Appendix to this report.

Implementation continues to be mostly smooth, and our project's monitoring phase is progressing in a timely fashion.

To date, this project is on track both in budget and within the timeline.
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule, or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We currently have no existing or anticipated problems with completion of Task 1 and consider this part of the project completed. 


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

The Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen at minimum as a living document and an active, constant process.

An updated version of the Adaptive Management Plan, and Biological Sampling Plan, were completed in June 2020. The elevation and biological sampling plans continue to evolve as we have now completed the second winter season of post-construction oyster sampling, and ongoing water quality sampling. For example, the variability in oyster counts observed in each strata (substrate, harvest status, location) collected in each winter sampling period is incorporated into our estimate of numbers samples required to achieve a known power of detecting change of particular magnitude for each upcoming sampling period. This sampling effort is then updated mid-winter sampling season based on observed count data collected during the first half of the winter sampling.  Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication.

**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
Work performed on Task 5. 

A. We have continued the water quality sampling program, collecting continuous information and downloading sondes every two weeks (see Sections 2 - 5). We have a relational database to track these data and we continue work to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/. We maintain a new Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan. 

https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page-1&size=20

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.  

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data for winter 2021-2022 sampling period have been entered, summarized, and preliminary analyses complete. Draft preliminary report is included as an Appendix.

. GF Young Surveyors completed post-construction elevation sampling in winter/spring 2020-2021. We have received this data and are processing the survey results at this time. We anticipate a brief report on these results at the next quarterly report.  

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
We are starting to see an increase in the errors in the water quality sensors. This may be due to the sensors starting to reach the end of their service life resulting in malfunctions or erratic recordings. These errors are not easily reproducible because the sensor may report as normal, but erratic data would have been recorded during the ~14 day deployment. We are working to address and may need to update several water quality sensors.


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
A paper brochure about the project continues to be distributed to the public via the local hardware and tackle shops, marinas, the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce, and UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station during the reporting period.  

We maintain two public educational displays about the Lone Cabbage restoration project at high traffic boat ramps in Cedar Key and Suwannee.  

We continue to update public information about the project primarily through the various electronic and social media produced by the Nature Coast Biological Station in Cedar Key https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/. The public can view data for water quality, oyster landings, and river discharge via the project Shiny App available here https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/ 

A.	Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

Regular posting of information on NCBS website, social media outlets, and newsletter.

**Task 7.  Data Management** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 7.

We continue to work with the UF Library Academic Resource Computing (LARC) team for technical assistance related to data storage for water quality, oyster count, and elevation data. By maintaining modern data collection and storage systems this facilitates our ability to rapidly analyze data and inform project decision making. This was demonstrated to NFWF staff during their site visit in December 2021.  

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate survey information from GF Young and others (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.

**Task 8.  Project Administration** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 8. 

***Subtask 8.1. Tracking expenditures***  
Generally, the budget is within the calendar schedule and on track for completion of all tasks. We reconcile budget vs. expenditure every six months and review project status and progress.   

***Subtask 8.2. Managing staff***
Two graduate students (Jamie Casteel and Matthew Richardson) are supported in full or part by this award. The Research Coordinator position remains vacant. Bill Pine has expanded his project duties to include responsibilities previously completed by Peter Frederick. Bill Pine, Matt Richardson, Jamie Casteel, and Jennifer Moore will increase project responsibilities to cover Brad's position until a determination is made as to how to re-fill the position. Several hourly technicians assist with the project in an as-needed basis primarily with field sampling efforts. 

All students and staff made presentations to NFWF personnel during the December 2021 site visit.

***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordination has been carried out through as-needed meetings and communications among the three principal investigators, graduate students, research coordinator, student OPS workers, and the UF Libraries data management group (LARC).  

Previous and continuing coordination activities with projects externel to this one have included coordination with county plans for additional oyster restoration activities (Sturmer, Pine), coordination with research planned for the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge hydrological restoration project (Allen), antipoaching actvities and oyster management by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Frederick, Pine, Sturmer), coordination with sampling of fishes on the Lone Cabbage Reef by Nature Coast Biological Station and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Allen), coordination with aquaculture activities in the area (Sturmer), coordination with Florida's Oyster Integrated Mapping and Monitoring Project (OIMMP, Pine and Ennis), participation in oyster research and restoration planning efforts by other entities in the region (FWC, TNC, UF, Sturmer, Pine, Allen).
