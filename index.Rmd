##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from April 2023 through July 2023. We are writing the final project report following the guidelines provided by NFWF.

To date, this project is within budget and timeline.  
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We consider this part of the project completed.


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

At a minimum, the Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen as a living document and an active, constant process.

We are using the Adaptive Management Plan as a guide for completing the final report.

We have followed an adaptive framework for all sampling. Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication. Moore JF and WE Pine III. 2021. Bootstrap methods can help evaluate monitoring
program performance to inform restoration as part of an adaptive management
program. PeerJ 9:e11378 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11378

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 4. 

No problems are anticipated with the implementation of Task 4, which is complete. 

  
**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
A.Work performed on Task 5. 

We continued the water quality sampling program until March 9, 2023 and then discontinued the program by retrieving the array. The decommissioning of the water quality array occurred several weeks after the last winter monitoring sample. Data have been uploaded into the relational database used to track these data. We have been working through a final QA/QC of the water quality data and we have received the last sampled from the LakeWatch lab. We continuously work to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/. We created a Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan.

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.   
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data for the current (winter 2022-2023) sampling period have been entered and summarized, and preliminary results are included as an Appendix. 

. GF Young Surveyors completed post-construction elevation sampling in winter/spring 2020-2021. We have received this data and are currently processing the survey results. While working on the survey data this quarter, we identified anomalies and incomplete records in some geosptial information. We worked extensively to identify and correct these anomalies, which necessitated hand-checking of spatial coordinates. Errors were corrected, and we can now resume working on the geospatial aspects of the project.

. Extreme heat, very high water temperatures (30 C or more), and an extended period of low river discharge followed by increasing discharge levels in late June led to some concern over water quality conditions causing oyster mortalities this quarter. We worked with our commmercial fishing cooperators to check oyster status at a small number of our sites, and unusual mortality patterns were not observed (photos in appendix).

. The Appendix report identifies all sampling completed during winter 2022-2023 and we have completed QA/QC of these data through ongoing analyses. We also note that winter 2022-2023 was the first period when the restored sites had higher counts than the unrestored sites.

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
We completed field work for Nathan Rogers degree program. We have worked with commercial oyster harvesters to provide spot checks on oyster population status during extreme heat. Project PI Bill Pine contracted Covid-19 in July and had to take sick leave. This caused some delays during this quarter with report writing.


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
We are working with Florida SeaGrant to develop a story board for the Lone Cabbage Project.

A. Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

PI Pine presented public seminars to the general public in the town of Cedar Key and to the Cedar Key Oystermens Association.

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget. 

This task appears to be within the budget proposed and on schedule.  

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 6. 

We do not anticipate any problems with the implementation of Task 6. 

**Task 7.  Data Management** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 7.

With the help of the UF library team we corrected unexpected errors in the geospatial inforamtion collected in 2021-2022.  

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate GF Young's and others' survey information (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.  
https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page=1&size=20

C.	Performance of Task 7 as against the Task 7 Budget. 

We are currently proceeding as scheduled for Task 7 and are within budget.

**Task 8.  Project Administration** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 8. 

***Subtask 8.1. Tracking expenditures***  
The project is underspent. The University of Florida Contracts and Grants office has been engaged with NFWF staff on budget status. PI Bill Pine worked with UF Contracts and Grants to reconcile expenditures within the completed tasks that was included in a spreadsheet of expenditures with questions provided by NFWF. 


***Subtask 8.2. Managing staff***
Two graduate students (Nate Rogers and Matthew Richardson) are supported in whole or part by this award. Jennifer Moore (former post-doc) in now a contractor and was able to commit some hours in June and July to the project. Challenges persist in paying her for this work. Joe Aufmuth (UF library) worked extensively on the geospatial inforamtion and related report components. Staff continue to be supervised by PI Bill Pine, who is working on all aspects of the project.

***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordinating meetings take place related to project completion as needed. PI Bill Pine meets with staff regularly via video conference and phone calls.

***Subtask 8.4. Reporting***
During this period, we have submitted requests for reimbursement for the July 2023 reporting period. PI Pine is working on the project final report based on input from NFWF.

B.	Progress made towards Task 8 milestones.

.	Fiscal reports and requests for reimbursement completed.  
.	Quarterly report completed through July 2023.  
.	Management and training graduate students.  
. Working on project final report.  

C.	Performance of Task 8 as against the Task 8 Budget. 

This Task appears to be within the Task 8 budget, and on schedule. 

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 8. 

None.  

##	Submission schedule for payment requests.

UF has submitted payment requests quarterly and we plan to continue this schedule. 

##  Any other information necessary for NFWF's evaluation of the Project's progress as measured against the Project Description, Budget, and Project schedule.

Project PI Bill Pine plans to separate from University of Florida employment. He is committed to finding a workable solution to complete the project as planned. Discussions have been ongoing between UF and NFWF related to a change in project administration and deliverables, but a plan has not been finalized. The resumption of direct communication between PI Pine and NFWF staff would be beneficial in addressing uncertainties in the level of detail involved in the final report.


##	Project products and deliverables produced during the applicable reporting period.  

See the Appendix for recent oyster photos (from J. Beckham) and draft analyses of the oyster count data. Summaries of water quality for the last year are provided in the subsequent sections.
