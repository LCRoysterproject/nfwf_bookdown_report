##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished during October through June 2021. 

Implementation continues to be mostly smooth and the monitoring phase of our project is progressing in a timely fashion. 

To date, this project is on track both in budget and within timeline. 
 
**i. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule, or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We currently have no existing or anticipated problems with completion of Task 1 and consider this part of the project completed. 


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

The Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen at minimum as a living document, and, as an active, constant process. 

An updated version of the Adaptive Management Plan, and Biological Sampling Plan, were completed in June 2020.  The elevation and biological sampling plans continue to evolve as we have now completed the second winter season of postconstruction oyster sampling, and ongoing water quality sampling. As an example, the variability in oyster counts observed in each strata (substrate, harvest status, location) collected in each winter sampling period is incorporated into our estimate of numbers samples required to achieve a known power of detecting change of particular magnitude for each upcoming sampling period.  This sampling effort is then updated mid-winter sampling season based on observed count data collected during the first half of the winter sampling.  Details of this adaptive approach are included in a recent peer-reviewed publication that was published this quarter in open-access journal PeerJ.

A. We have continued the water quality sampling program, collecting continuous information and downloading sondes every two weeks (see Sections 2 - 5). We have a relational database to track these data and to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information from this project is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/.  We employed a group of eight commercial oyster harvesters from the Suwannee Sound region to assist with an experimental assessment of sub-tidal oyster populations.  Data collected from this effort in June 2021 are still being assessed.

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data entered, summarized, and analyses complete (updates provided in last quarterly report).  Sampling effort for winter 2021-2022 currently being planned. 

.	Postconstruction elevation sampling was completed by GF Young Surveyors in winter/spring 2020 - 2021 and we are awaiting data from this sub-contract. 

.	Work with commercial oyster harvesters to experimentally assess sub-tidal oyster populations near Lone Cabbage and at a control site. 

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
We do not anticipate any major problems with the implementation of Task 5.


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed, this subtask has been completed and there is no new information to report. 

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
A paper brochure about the project continues to be distributed to the public via the local hardware and tackle shops, marinas, the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce, and UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station during the reporting period. 
We maintain two public educational displays about the Lone Cabbage restoration project at high traffic boat ramps in Cedar Key and Suwannee. A third display at a remote boat ramp in Dixie County (Shired Island) was badly vandalized, and we removed the display. 

We continue to update public information about the project primarily through the various electronic and social media produced by the Nature Coast Biological Station in Cedar Key https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/. Data can be seen by the public for water quality and other related material via the project Shiny Ap of data visualization available here https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/

We published a paper in the open-access peer-reviewed journal "PeerJ" on monitoring program performance related to an adaptive management program (see Task 2A). This paper includes supplemental material that can be used to replicate the simulations used in the paper in other situations to inform monitoring program performance. Publication costs were not charged to the project for this manuscript.  As an open-access publication the information is available to the general public and resource practitioners conducting similar research.

We met in-person with FWC staff to review ongoing and proposed oyster restoration efforts in the Suwannee Sound region.  We continue to share with FWC internal documents related to Lone Cabbage Reef monitoring program design, data management, automation tools for summarizing data, water quality monitoring array design, and related content.  Following discussions with NFWF staff, we anticipate having a meeting with FWC, NFWF, and UF personnel in fall 2021 to discuss sampling planning efforts for NFWF funded projects in the region.

A.	Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

Regular posting of information on NCBS websites. Resumption of limited in-person meetings with FWC collaborators and commercial oyster havesters.

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget. 

This task appears to be within the budget proposed and on schedule.  

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 6.

**Task 8.  Project Administration** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 8. 

***Subtask 8.1. Tracking expenditures***  
Generally, the budget is well within the calendar schedule, and seems healthy for the completion of all tasks. We have now initiated a one-year internal audit (October annually) to summarize annual expenditures on this project in detail. This audit will be performed during the next quarter. Any outstanding issues with the budget will be reported. With the agreement of NFWF staff, we re-allocated funds that were committed to Peter Frederick's salary following his retirement. 

***Subtask 8.2. Managing staff***
Graduate student Mel Moreno who led data science efforts in support of the project and has completed her degree and graduated.  Two other graduate students are supported in full or part by this award (Jamie Castell and Matthew Richardson) and a third is working with data from this project but is supported by a fellowship (Tyler Coleman).  Brad Ennis is the project Research Coordinator.  Bill Pine has expanded his project duties to include responsibilities previously completed by Peter Frederick.  We have worked with NFWF to re-allocate salary dedicated to Peter Frederick following his retirement. These funds have not been allocated. Several hourly technicians assist with the project in an as-needed basis primarily with field sampling efforts.

***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordination has been carried out through as-needed meetings and communications among the three principal investigators, and the research coordinator and student OPS workers. We also meet on an as-needed basis with personnel associated with the UF Libraries data management group (LARC) as we fine-tune the data management system for this project and embark on special projects like elevation sampling. 

Coordination activities with projects external to this one have included coordination with county plans for additional oyster restoration activities (Sturmer, Pine), coordination with research planned for the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge hydrological restoration project (Pine), antipoaching activities and oyster management by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Frederick, Pine, Sturmer), coordination with sampling of fishes on the Lone Cabbage Reef by Nature Coast Biological Station and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Pine), coordination with aquaculture activities in the area (Sturmer), coordination with Florida's Oyster Integrated Mapping and Monitoring Program (OIMMP, Pine and Ennis), participation in oyster research and restoration planning efforts by other entities in the region (FWC, TNC, UF, Sturmer, Pine, Allen) We are also actively pursuing a number of different grants with collaborators who are interested in leveraging the Lone Cabbage Reef experiment to better understand upstream land use linkages with coastal ecology and fisheries.
