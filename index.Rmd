##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from October 2023 through December 2023. We are writing the final project report following the guidelines provided by NFWF.

To date, this project is under budget and ahead of schedule.
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We consider this part of the project completed.


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

At a minimum, the Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen as a living document and an active, constant process.

We are using the Adaptive Management Plan as a guide for completing the final report.

We have followed an adaptive framework for all sampling. Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication. Moore JF and WE Pine III. 2021. Bootstrap methods can help evaluate monitoring
program performance to inform restoration as part of an adaptive management
program. PeerJ 9:e11378 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11378

B.	Progress made towards Task 2 milestones.

We are using the Adaptive Management Plan to guide completion of the final report.

C.	Performance of Task 2 as against the Task 2 Budget. 

Task 2 is within the timeline and budget set out in the proposal.

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 2. 

We do not anticipate any problems with the implementation of Task 2.


**Task 3.  Preconstruction Monitoring**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 3. 

All phases of preconstruction monitoring have been completed as of December 2018. 

B.	Progress made towards Task 3 milestones.

All subtasks within Task 3 have been completed. 

C.	Performance of Task 3 as against the Task 3 Budget. 

This task is well within budget and the spending schedule as identified in the proposal. 

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 3. 

This task is completed.  


**Task 4.  Construction**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 4.

All construction activities were completed by November of 2018, so no new work is reported here.  

B.	Progress made towards Task 4 milestones.

All aspects of reef construction were completed as of November 30, 2018.

C.	Performance of Task 4 as against the Task 4 Budget. 

This task has been completed on schedule and within budget. 

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 4. 

No problems are anticipated with the implementation of Task 4, which is complete. 

  
**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
A.Work performed on Task 5. 

We continued the water quality sampling program until March 9, 2023 and then discontinued the program by retrieving the array. The decommissioning of the water quality array occurred several weeks after the last winter monitoring sample. Data have been uploaded into the relational database used to track these data. We created a Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan.

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.

We have a draft of the first phase of the water quality monitoring included as an appendix. This will be revised into the final report format.

We also have a draft of the analyses of the counts included as an appendix. This will be revised into the final report format.  

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.   
.	Progress made on completing analyses of the elevation data. First drafts of the basic water quality analyses and oyster count analyses are completed and ready to be converted into NFWF reporting format.  
. We hope to submit oyster height manuscript.  

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
Nathan Rogers was on sick leave for the reporting period and count not work. Bill Pine has a 20% appointment. The required hours to complete the project are more than the appointment.  


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
We worked with Cedar Key Oystermen's Association to develop ideas for future restoration efforts using the "County" dollars from DWY.  

A. Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget.

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate GF Young's and others' survey information (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.  
https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page=1&size=20

Jennifer Moore (former post-doc) in now a contractor and was able to commit some hours to the project this reporting period. Nate Rogers was on medical leave during the semester. Matt Richardson is on track to graduate in May. Joe Aufmuth (UF library) worked extensively on the geospatial information and related report components. Staff continue to be supervised by PI Bill Pine. Bill Pine is working on all aspects of the project.   

***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordinating meetings related to project completion take place as needed. PI Bill Pine meets with staff regularly via video conference, phone calls, and in-person.

***Subtask 8.4. Reporting***
