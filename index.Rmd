##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from July through October 2022. For reference, we have included information in section 3 as the results from the 2021-2022 winter sampling. We have attached an Appendix that provides the final sampling framework for winter 2022-2023 as the winter sampling season will begin October 27, 2022.

Implementation continues to be mostly smooth, and our project's monitoring phase is progressing in a timely fashion.

To date, this project is on track both in budget and within the timeline.
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We currently have no existing or anticipated problems with he completion of Task 1 and consider this part of the project completed. 


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

The Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen at minimum as a living document and an active, constant process.

An updated version of the Adaptive Management Plan, and Biological Sampling Plan, were completed in June 2020. The elevation and biological sampling plans continue to evolve as we have completed the fourth winter season of post-construction oyster sampling, and ongoing water quality sampling. For example, the variability in oyster counts observed in each strata (substrate, harvest status, location) collected in each winter sampling period is incorporated into our estimate of number of samples required to achieve a known power of detecting change of particular magnitude for each sampling period. This sampling effort is then updated mid-winter sampling season based on observed count data collected during the first half of the winter sampling. Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication.

**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
Work performed on Task 5. 

A. We have continued the water quality sampling program, collecting continuous information and downloading sondes approximately every two weeks (see Sections 2 - 5). We have a relational database to track these data and we continuously work to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/. We maintain a Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan. 

https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page-1&size=20

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.  

We have made progress analyzing the post-construction elevation information, but this effort was slowed during late summer and fall as we prepared for field sampling.

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.   
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data for winter 2021-2022 sampling period have been entered, summarized, and analyses complete and provided in earlier reports and included here again as section 3. Sampling plans for winter 2022-2023 are completed and provided as an appendix in this report.   

. We are training commercial oyster harvesters and FWC staff on field survey methods and these people will assist us with winter field sampling efforts (photos in Appendix).   

. We are working on a draft manuscript of the post-construction survey data.    

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
Hurricane Ian came ashore in October 2022 near Ft. Myers. While the Lone Cabbage Reef location was far from landfall, wave action and anomalous tides caused some issues for the project, including a missing water quality sensor. We are still searching for this sensor.

There are some gaps from this reporting period in the water quality monitoring due to missing data from the original sensor array or errors in the recorded observations by the sensors. We have a second array that has been deployed for a shorter period that is closer to Lone Cabbage Reef than the original water quality array. The sensors used in this array appear to be functioning better, and we will work during the next quarter to consolidate these data and work to correct erroneous measurements or fill data gaps if possible. We have made significant progress in modeling the water quality data (salinity) based on river discharge and wind information (M. Richardson, Ph.D. student), and we will be able to present some of these results in 1-2 quarters.

We continue to be significantly understaffed. While this results in cost-savings to the grant the work load for remaining staff is substantial. We have filled gaps in field sampling crews with local oyster harvesters and FWC has committed staff to helping with sampling efforts.


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
A paper brochure about the project continues to be distributed to the public via the local hardware and tackle shops, marinas, the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce, and UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station during the reporting period.  

We maintain two public educational displays about the Lone Cabbage restoration project at high traffic boat ramps in Cedar Key and Suwannee.  

We continue to update public information about the project primarily through the various electronic and social media produced by the Nature Coast Biological Station in Cedar Key https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/. The public can view data for water quality, oyster landings, and river discharge via the project Shiny App available here https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/ 

We presented post-construction results at a joint meeting with the NFWF funded Suwannee Sound - Apalachicola Bay oyster project with commercial harvesters from Cedar Key and Suwannee Sound. We discussed results of the Lone Cabbage project as well as how lessons from Lone Cabbage could be applied to other types of oyster reefs in the region. 

A.	Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

Regular posting of information on NCBS website, social media outlets, and presentations to practitioners.

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget. 

This task appears to be within the budget proposed and on schedule.  

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 6. 

We do not anticipate any problems with the implementation of Task 6. 

**Task 7.  Data Management** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 7.

We continue to work with the UF Library Academic Resource Computing (LARC) team for technical assistance related to data storage for water quality, oyster count, and elevation data. By maintaining modern data collection and storage systems this facilitates our ability to rapidly analyze data and inform project decision making. This was demonstrated to NFWF staff during their site visit in December 2021.  

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate survey information from GF Young and others (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.  
https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page=1&size=20

**Task 8.  Project Administration** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 8. 

***Subtask 8.1. Tracking expenditures***  
Generally, the budget is within the calendar schedule and on track for the completion of all tasks. We reconcile budget vs. expenditure every six months and review project status and progress.   

***Subtask 8.2. Managing staff***
Three graduate students (Jamie Casteel, Matthew Richardson, and Nathan Rogers) are supported in full or part by this award. Jamie Casteel successfully defended her MS thesis and graduated in August 2022. The Research Coordinator position remains vacant. Bill Pine has expanded his project duties to include responsibilities previously completed by Peter Frederick. Bill Pine also covers most of the Research Coordinator's responsibilities. Dylan Sinnickson is working <10 hours per month as an OPS staff member to assist with analyses of the oyster heights data. We have three commercial oyster harvesters who have been helping us regularly service the water quality monitoring array. We are also training oyster harvesters and FWC staff to participate in the oyster survey efforts. The first training day for this work was October 25, 2022.

***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordination has been carried out through as-needed meetings and communications among the principal investigators, graduate students, and the UF Libraries data management group (LARC).  

Previous and continuing coordination activities with projects external to this one have included coordination with county plans for additional oyster restoration activities (Sturmer, Pine), coordination with research planned for the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife Refuge hydrological restoration project (Allen), antipoaching activities and oyster management by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Pine), coordination with sampling of fishes on the Lone Cabbage Reef by Nature Coast Biological Station and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Allen), coordination with aquaculture activities in the area (Sturmer), coordination with Florida's Oyster Integrated Mapping and Monitoring Project (OIMMP, Pine), participation in oyster research and restoration planning efforts by other entities in the region (FWC, TNC, UF, Pine).  

We are meeting regularly with Cedar Key Oystermen's Association members.
