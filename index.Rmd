##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from August 2023 through October 2023. We are writing the final project report following the guidelines provided by NFWF.

To date, this project is within budget and timeline.  
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We consider this part of the project completed.


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

At a minimum, the Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen as a living document and an active, constant process.

We are using the Adaptive Management Plan as a guide for completing the final report.

We have followed an adaptive framework for all sampling. Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication. Moore JF and WE Pine III. 2021. Bootstrap methods can help evaluate monitoring
program performance to inform restoration as part of an adaptive management
program. PeerJ 9:e11378 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11378

D.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 4. 

No problems are anticipated with the implementation of Task 4, which is complete. 

  
**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
A.Work performed on Task 5. 

We continued the water quality sampling program until March 9, 2023 and then discontinued the program by retrieving the array. The decommissioning of the water quality array occurred several weeks after the last winter monitoring sample. Data have been uploaded into the relational database used to track these data. We have been working through a final QA/QC of the water quality data and we have received the last samples from the LakeWatch lab. We continuously work to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/. We created a Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan.

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.   
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data for the current (winter 2022-2023) sampling period have been entered and summarized, and preliminary results are included as an Appendix. 

. GF Young Surveyors completed post-construction elevation sampling in winter/spring 2020-2021. We have received this data and are currently processing the survey results. While working on the survey data this quarter, we identified anomalies and incomplete records in some geospatial information. We worked extensively to identify and correct these anomalies, which necessitated hand-checking of spatial coordinates. Errors were corrected, and we can now resume working on the geospatial aspects of the project.

. Hurricane Idalia made landfall approximately 30-km north of Cedar Key adn less than 20-km from the Lone Cabbage Reef on August 30, 2023. Idalia produced the largest recorded storm surge during the period of instrument record for Cedar Key and led to widespread damage to public and private property and natural features. We have conducted basic bisual assessments of the Lone Cabbage Reef and found that the rocks appear to be in place as designed. It does appear that oyster clusters that were between the rocks during winter 2022-2023 have been displaced and may be concentrated on the landward side of the reef. There appears to have been some sedimentation of the reef on the lower 1/3 of reef elements. We are unsure whether permitting agencies or NFWF would like us to investigate this further.

. We have provided a draft manuscript on oyster reef heights as an appendix.

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
Nathan Rogers has been on sick leave for most of the reporting period and unable to work. Bill Pine has transitioned to 50% employment with the University of Florida. He is committed to completing the project as agreed but is no longer able to meet workload demands to complete the project as he has done in recent years. 


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
We are working with Florida SeaGrant to develop a story board for the Lone Cabbage Project.

Bill Pine met with the Cedar Key Aquaculture Association and Cedar Key community members on August 15 and 16 in Cedar Key. He presented an overview of the Lone Cabbage Reef project and had extensive discussions with the community related to concerns that have recently emerged within the community related to whether or not the restoration of Lone Cabbage Reef altered water quality in shellfish lease areas. This was motivated by large observed losses in farmed clam resources during summer 2023. Lone Cabbage Reef results do not suggest that the restoration led to any changes in water quality in the shellfish lease areas. This conclusion seems to be accepted by the Cedar Key Aquaculture Association leadership, but not some focal members. This led to further discussions about a deployment of the old, but operable, salinity sensors from the Lone Cabbage restoration project near the lease sites. However, these discussions were abandoned after the region was heavily damaged by Hurricane Idalia about two weeks later.

A. Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

PI Pine presented public seminars to the general public in the town of Cedar Key and to the Cedar Key Oystermens Association.

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget. 

This task appears to be within the budget proposed and on schedule.  

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 6. 

We do not anticipate any problems with the implementation of Task 6. 

**Task 7.  Data Management** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 7.

With the help of the UF library team we corrected unexpected errors in the geospatial information collected in 2021-2022.  

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate GF Young's and others' survey information (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.  
https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page=1&size=20

C.	Performance of Task 7 as against the Task 7 Budget. 

We are currently proceeding as scheduled for Task 7 and are within budget.

None anticipated. 


**Task 8.  Project Administration** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 8. 

***Subtask 8.1. Tracking expenditures***  
The project is underspent. We have worked to close out financials related to the project.


***Subtask 8.2. Managing staff***
Two graduate students (Nate Rogers and Matthew Richardson) are supported in whole or part by this award. Jennifer Moore (former post-doc) in now a contractor and was able to commit some hours in June and July to the project. Nate Rogers has been on medical leave most of the semester. Joe Aufmuth (UF library) worked extensively on the geospatial information and related report components. Staff continue to be supervised by PI Bill Pine, who is working on all aspects of the project but has reduced UF appointment.  


***Subtask 8.3. Coordination***
Coordinating meetings take place related to project completion as needed. PI Bill Pine meets with staff regularly via video conference, phone calls, and in-person.

***Subtask 8.4. Reporting***
During this period, we have submitted requests for reimbursement for the October 2023 reporting period and have completed the quarterly report for the October 2023 reporting period. PI Pine is working on the project final report based on input from NFWF.
