Project Title:	Recovery and Resilience of Oyster Reefs in the Big Bend of Florida		
Organization:	University of Florida				
Project Term:	12/01/2016 - 11/30/2024   
Reporting Quarter: Ending December 2022 


##	General statement of project status and implementation.  

This report includes work accomplished from October through December 2022. Because this is the quarter when most of our oyster feld sampling takes place, we have included some summary data through 9 January 2023. A complete summary of oyster count data will be made in the next reporting period.

Implementation continues to be mostly smooth, and our project's monitoring phase is progressing promptly.

To date, this project is within budget and timeline.  
 
**ii. Updates on individual tasks.** 
  
**Task 1.  Planning and Permitting**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 1. 

All work on this task was completed by January of 2018.

B.	Performance of Task 1 as against the Task 1 Budget. 

All subtasks in Task 1 have been completed on schedule or ahead of schedule, and we remain within budget.

C.	Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 1. 

We consider this part of the project completed.


**Task 2.  Develop Adaptive Monitoring Plan**  
 A.	Work performed on Task 2.

The Adaptive Management Plan for this project should be seen at minimum as a living document and an active, constant process.

An updated version of the Adaptive Management Plan, and Biological Sampling Plan, were completed in June 2020. The elevation and biological sampling plans continue to evolve as we have completed the fourth winter season of post-construction oyster sampling, and ongoing water quality sampling. For example, the variability in oyster counts observed in each stratum (substrate, harvest status, location) collected in each winter sampling period is incorporated into our estimate of number of samples required to achieve a known power of detecting change of particular magnitude for each upcoming sampling period (i.e., winter 2022-2023). This sampling effort is then updated mid-winter sampling season based on observed count data collected during the first half of the winter sampling. Details of this adaptive approach are included in a peer-reviewed publication.

**Task 5. Post-Construction Monitoring**  
Work performed on Task 5. 

A. We have continued the water quality sampling program, collecting continuous information and downloading sondes approximately every two weeks (see Sections 2 - 5). We have a relational database to track these data and we continuously work to develop relationships between water quality data, survey information, and oyster populations (Task 7). Water quality information is publicly available and summarized on the website https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/. We maintain a Zenodo repository and posted a copy of all oyster count data to this repository as described in our data management plan. 

https://zenodo.org/communities/uf_ifas_oysterproject/?page-1&size=20

This repository will also store code used to complete analyses of various aspects of this project. This is an ongoing effort.  

B. Progress made towards Task 5 milestones.   
.	Postconstruction biological sampling of oyster density and size on all study reefs completed for each winter sampling period. Data for the current (winter 2022-2023) sampling period have been entered and summarized and preliminary summaries are included as an appendix. The sampling effort for winter 2022-2023 is continuing.   

. GF Young Surveyors completed post-construction elevation sampling in winter/spring 2020-2021. We have received this data and are currently processing the survey results. We hope to complete a manuscript on these data this quarter. 

C. Performance of Task 5 as against the Task 5 Budget. 
This task is within schedule and budget. 

D. Existing or anticipated problems with implementation of Task 5. 
There are some gaps for this reporting period in the water quality monitoring due to missing data from the original sensor array or errors in the recorded observations by the sensors. Hurricane Ian came ashore in October 2022 near Ft. Myers. While the Lone Cabbage Reef location was far from landfall, wave action and anomalous tides caused some issues for the project, including a missing water quality sensor. We have been unable to locate this missing sensor. We have also had several other sensors disappear or malfunction this quarter. We suspect these sensors were vandalized and are missing or did not work correctly beause they were tampered with. This is the first quarter we have experienced these issues in this project. We have made significant progress in modeling the water quality data (salinity) based on river discharge and wind information (M. Richardson, Ph.D. student), and we will be able to present some of these results in 1-2 quarters. This modeling framework will help compensate for missing water quality observations apparent in the data summaries included in this report.  

We have employed a rotating crew of local oyster harvesters to assist with all water quality and field sampling efforts. We also have the cooperation of FWC staff, who have also worked with us to complete oyster sampling efforts.  

As we have discussed with NFWF staff on the phone, we anticipate winter 2022-2023 will be our last oyster transect sampling on the reef. We will conduct limited field operations during the first and second quarters of 2023 to wrap up sampling efforts and disassemble the water quality array. We are working on transferring the water quality array and oyster monitoring work to FWC as part of their NFWF-funded efforts in this area.


**Task 6.  Outreach and Education** 
Work performed on Task 6.  

***Subtask 6.1.  Preconstruction outreach and education***   
Since construction has been completed there is no new information to report.

***Subtask 6.2.  Post-construction education and outreach*** 
During the reporting period, a paper brochure about the project continues to be distributed to the public via the local hardware and tackle shops, marinas, the Cedar Key Chamber of Commerce, and UF/IFAS Nature Coast Biological Station.

We maintain two public educational displays about the Lone Cabbage restoration project at high traffic boat ramps in Cedar Key and Suwannee.  

We continue to update public information about the project primarily through the various electronic and social media produced by the Nature Coast Biological Station in Cedar Key https://ncbs.ifas.ufl.edu/. The public can view data for water quality, oyster landings, and river discharge via the project Shiny App available here https://lcroysterproject.github.io/oysterproject/ 

A.	Progress made towards Task 6 milestones.

Regular posting information on NCBS website, social media outlets, and newsletter.  

B.	Performance of Task 6 as against the Task 6 Budget.

**Task 7.  Data Management** 

 A.	Work performed on Task 7.

We continue to work with the UF Library Academic Resource Computing (LARC) team for technical assistance related to data storage for water quality, oyster count, and elevation data. Maintaining modern data collection and storage systems facilitates our ability to analyze data rapidly and inform project decision-making. This was demonstrated to NFWF staff during their site visit in December 2021.  

B.	 Progress made towards Task 7 milestones.

Database efforts for water quality and oyster count data are in place and operational. Effort continues to integrate GF Young's and others' survey information (pre and post-construction) into a common framework. We created a Zenodo repository for oyster count data.

##	Submission schedule for payment requests.

UF has submitted payment requests quarterly and we plan to continue this schedule. 

##  Any other information necessary for NFWF's evaluation of the Project's progress as measured against the Project Description, Budget, and Project schedule.

We have provided two short appendices that describe our field efforts so far for winter 2022-2023 sampling period and our simulation analyses completed in January 2023 to update our sampling efforts for the remainder of the winter effort. We hosted NFWF staff for a site visit in December 2021, where we toured the reef and made brief presentations documenting project progress. NFWF staff provided positive feedback on the information presented. NFWF staff requested permission to share the Lone Cabbage Reef adapative management plan with FWC, and we are glad these documents can be of use to cooperators. We completed a series of training efforts on oyster count methodologies with FWC staff and commercial oyster harvesters. We are encouraged that FWC staff and commercial oyster harvesters work cooperatively as part of field teams for this project. We have phone calls at irregular intervals as needed with NFWF staff.
